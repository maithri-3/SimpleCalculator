                                ***SIMPLE CALCULATOR***

-> I have tried to create a calculator using the languages HTML, CSS (for styling) and JavaScript.

-> The calculator can perform basic operations- addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and trigonometric functions.

-> The calculator is very primitive and I am hoping to add more features and make the calculator more user friendly.(The trigonometric functions need to take the input in a better manner)
